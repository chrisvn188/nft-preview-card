## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this first project of Frontend Mentor, I learned a new way to set overlay background color on an image. Besides, I reviewed a bit about flexbox, positioning.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.overlay {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: var(--primary-cyan);
  z-index: 1;
  opacity: 0;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  border-radius: inherit;
}
```

### Continued development

I will apply what I learned about Flexbox and Grid layout to build future projects in order to strengthen my skills.

### Useful resources
